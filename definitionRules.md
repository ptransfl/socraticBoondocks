1. A definition should be coextensive with the thing defined: neither too broad nor too narrow. (This is the most important rule, and the hard- est to obey. It concerns the extension of the term rather than the com- prehension.)
2. A definition should be clear, not obscure.
3. A definition should be literal, not metaphorical.
4. A definition should be brief, not long.
5. A definition should be positive, not negative, if possible. (Only negative realities call for negative definitions.)
6. A definition should not be circular. (The term defined cannot appear in
the definition.)
