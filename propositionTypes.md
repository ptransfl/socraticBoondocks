Every proposition has a matter, or content, and a form. The matter of a proposition is its two terms, its subject term and its predicate term. The content of these two terms is almost infinitely variable. Propositions can say anythingabout anything. But the form of a simple (categorical) proposition consists in only two variables: the "quantity" and the "quality."
The "quantity" of a proposition means how much of the subject we are talk- ing about, all or some. The quantity is either universal (all) or particular (some).
The "quality" of the proposition means whether it is affirmative or nega- tive, whether the predicate is affirmed of the subject or denied of the subject.
The "matter," then, is the two terms, and the "form" tells how these two terms (the subject and the predicate) are related to each other.
Since a proposition can be either universal or particular in quantity and either affirmative or negative in quality, there are four possibilities:
A: universal affirmative propositions (e.g. "All men are mortal")
E: universal negative propositions (e.g. "No men are mortal")
I: particular affirmative propositions (e.g. "Some men are mortal") O: particular negative propositions (e.g. "Some men are not mortal")
The four logical forms of categorical propositions are called A, E, I, and O for short. This tradition comes from medieval Latin: A and I are the first two vowels in the Latin word afprmoy which means "I affirm." An A proposition is universal and affirmative (all S is P) and an I proposition is particular and affir- mative (some S is P). E and O arc the first two vowels in the Latin word nego, which means "I deny." An E proposition is universal and negative (no S is P), and an O proposition is particular and negative (some S is not P).

The predicate of an affirmative proposition is always undistributed; the predicate of a negative proposition is always distributed. That is the simple, universal rule.


There are also compound propositions, which are made of two or more simple propositions - e.g. "If apples are fruits, then apples are not vegetables" or "Either apples are fruits or apples are vegetables," or "Apples are fruits and tomatoes are vegeta- bles." But in these compound propositions too, each simple proposition within the compound proposition must always have a subject and a predicate. We will study compound propositions a few chapters later. There are three kinds: hypo- thetical ("if. . . then . . ."), disjunctive ("either . . . or . . ."), and conjunctive ("both . . . and . . ." or "not both . . . and . . .").

These propositions are used in compound syllogisms of the same names.
