Rule 1: A syllogism must have three and only three terms. The usual vio-
lation of this rule is called The Fallacy of Four Terms.
Rule 2: A syllogism must have three and only three propositions. There
is no named fallacy for the violation of this rule.
Rule 3: The middle term must be distributed at least once. The violation
of this rule is called The Fallacy of Undistributed Middle.
Rule 4: No term that is undistributed in the premise may be distributed
in the conclusion. The violation of this rule is called The Fallacy of Illicit Minor or The Fallacy of Illicit Major, depending on whether it is the minor term or the major term that contains the fallacy.
Rule 5: No syllogism can have two negative premises. The fallacy here is called simply the fallacy of Two Negative Premises.
Rule 6: If one premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative; and if the conclusion is negative, one premise must be negative. (No name for this fallacy; just the rule.)
