# Logical Fallacies Summary

## 1. Fallacies of Language

A. Equivocation  
Using a word or phrase with multiple meanings in different senses within the same argument. This creates confusion by exploiting the ambiguity of language to reach false conclusions.

  B. Amphiboly  
Misleading arguments that arise from ambiguous grammar or sentence structure. The confusion comes from unclear syntax rather than word meanings.

  C. Accent  
Changing the meaning of a statement by emphasizing different words or taking quotes out of their original context. The fallacy occurs when emphasis alters the intended meaning.

  D. Slanting  
Presenting information in a biased way by selecting emotionally charged words or framing facts to support a particular viewpoint. This manipulates the audience's emotional response rather than addressing the logical merits.

  E. Slogans  
Using catchy phrases or memorable sayings as substitutes for actual arguments. These oversimplified statements often bypass critical thinking through repetition and emotional appeal.

  F. Hyperbole  
Making exaggerated claims or overstatements that distort the truth to make an argument seem stronger. The exaggeration misleads by presenting extreme cases as typical or normal.

  G. "Straw Man"  
Misrepresenting someone's argument by creating a weaker, distorted version that's easier to attack. The arguer then defeats this false version while claiming to have refuted the original position.

## 2. Fallacies of Diversion

  A. Ad hominem (The Appeal to the Person)  
Attacking the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. This includes poisoning the well, tu quoque ("you too"), and the genetic fallacy.

  B. Ad verecundiam (The Appeal to Illegitimate Authority)  
Citing an authority figure who lacks relevant expertise in the subject being discussed. The fallacy occurs when the authority's credentials don't qualify them to speak on the specific topic.

  C. Ad baculum (The Appeal to Force)  
Using threats or force to compel acceptance of a conclusion rather than providing logical reasons. This substitutes coercion for rational persuasion.

  D. Ad misericordiam (The Appeal to Pity)  
Attempting to win an argument by evoking sympathy or pity rather than providing relevant evidence. The emotional appeal distracts from the logical merits of the case.

  E. Ad ignominiam (The Appeal to Shame)  
Using shame, embarrassment, or social pressure to force acceptance of a position. This manipulates social emotions rather than addressing the actual argument.

  F. Ad populum (The Appeal to the Masses)  
Arguing that something is true or right because many people believe it or do it. This includes flattery, identification tactics, bandwagon appeals, polling data as proof, prejudice appeals, snob appeal, and "the big lie."

  G. Ad ignorantiam (The Appeal to Ignorance)  
Claiming something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. This shifts the burden of proof inappropriately and exploits gaps in knowledge.

## 3. Fallacies of Oversimplification

  A. Dicto simpliciter  
Applying a general rule to a specific case where it doesn't appropriately apply due to special circumstances. This ignores relevant exceptions or particular conditions that would change the conclusion.

  B. "Special Case"  
The reverse of dicto simpliciter—treating an exception as if it were the general rule. This takes atypical situations and applies them broadly where they don't belong.

  C. Composition  
Assuming that what's true of the parts must be true of the whole. This ignores how individual components might behave differently when combined into a larger system.

  D. Division  
Assuming that what's true of the whole must be true of its individual parts. This overlooks how properties of a collective might not apply to individual members.

  E. "The Black-and-White Fallacy"  
Presenting only two extreme options when more alternatives exist. This false dilemma forces a choice between polarized positions while ignoring middle ground or other possibilities.

  F. Quoting out of Context  
Taking statements or evidence out of their original context to change their meaning or significance. This distorts the speaker's intended message by removing crucial surrounding information.

  G. Stereotyping  
Making broad generalizations about groups based on limited examples or prejudicial assumptions. This oversimplifies complex human diversity and ignores individual differences.

## 4. Fallacies of Argumentation

  A. Non sequitur ("It Does Not Follow")  
Drawing a conclusion that doesn't logically follow from the premises presented. The connection between the evidence and conclusion is missing or invalid.

  B. Ignoratio Elenchi (Irrelevant Conclusion)  
Proving something other than what was originally at issue. The argument may be valid but addresses the wrong question or proves an irrelevant point.

  C. Petitio principii ("Begging the Question")  
Assuming the truth of what you're trying to prove within your premises. This circular reasoning uses the conclusion as evidence for itself.

  D. "Complex Question"  
Asking a question that contains an unproven assumption, making any direct answer problematic. The classic example is "Have you stopped beating your wife?"

  E. Arguing in a Circle  
Using a conclusion as evidence for the premises that are supposed to support that conclusion. This creates a logical loop where nothing is actually proven.

  F. Contradictory Premises  
Building an argument on premises that contradict each other. Since contradictory statements cannot both be true, the argument's foundation is logically unsound.

  G. False Assumption  
Basing an argument on an assumption that is incorrect or unproven. The entire argument fails because its foundation is faulty.

## 5. Fallacies of Induction

  A. Hasty Generalization  
Drawing broad conclusions from too few examples or unrepresentative samples. This rushes to judgment without sufficient evidence to support the generalization.

  B. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc ("After this, therefore caused by this")  
Assuming that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second. This confuses correlation with causation and ignores other possible explanations.

  C. Hypothesis Contrary to Fact  
Making claims about what would have happened in alternative scenarios that cannot be tested. These counterfactual arguments are unprovable and often used to avoid responsibility.

  D. False Analogy  
Comparing two things that are not sufficiently similar to support the conclusion drawn. The analogy breaks down because the differences between the compared items are more significant than their similarities.

  E. Argument from Silence  
Concluding that something is true because there's no evidence against it, or that absence of evidence proves something. This misinterprets what lack of information actually means.

  F. Selective Evidence  
Cherry-picking only the evidence that supports your position while ignoring contradictory evidence. This creates a biased and incomplete picture of the available information.

  G. Slanting the Question  
Asking questions in a way that predisposes certain answers or frames the issue unfairly. The wording of the question influences responses in a biased direction.

## 6. Procedural Fallacies

  A. "Refuting" an Argument by Refuting its Conclusion  
Attempting to disprove an argument by showing its conclusion is false, without addressing the reasoning. Even if the conclusion is wrong, the argument's logic might still be valid with different premises.

  B. Assuming that Refuting an Argument Disproves Its Conclusion  
Believing that if you can show an argument is flawed, you've proven its conclusion false. A bad argument doesn't necessarily mean the conclusion is incorrect—there might be better arguments for the same conclusion.

  C. Ignoring an Argument  
Simply refusing to acknowledge or address an opponent's argument. This avoids engagement with the actual reasoning presented.

  D. Substituting Explanations for Proof  
Offering explanations of how something might be true instead of providing evidence that it is true. Explanations show possibility; proof demonstrates actuality.

  E. Answering Another Argument than the One Given  
Responding to a different argument than what was actually presented. This deflects from the real issue by addressing irrelevant points.

  F. Shifting the Burden of Proof  
Requiring your opponent to disprove your claim rather than providing evidence for it yourself. The person making a positive claim bears the responsibility to support it.

  G. Winning the Argument but Losing the Arguer, or Vice Versa  
Focusing so much on defeating the person that you ignore their argument, or being so concerned with personal relationships that you fail to address logical problems. This confuses interpersonal dynamics with logical evaluation.

## 7. Metaphysical Fallacies

  A. Reductionism or "Nothing Buttery"  
Claiming that complex phenomena are "nothing but" their simplest components, ignoring emergent properties. This confuses different levels of explanation and reduces everything to material causes.

  B. The Fallacy of Accident (Confusing the Accidental with the Essential)  
Treating incidental characteristics as if they were essential features of something. This mistakes superficial or temporary qualities for fundamental properties.

  C. Confusing Quantity with Quality  
Assuming that more of something automatically means better, or that numerical measures capture all important aspects. This reduces qualitative differences to mere quantitative ones.

  D. The Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness  
Treating abstract concepts as if they were concrete physical things. This reifies ideas, numbers, or theoretical constructs by giving them inappropriate material properties.

  E. Confusing the Logical, Psychological, and Physical "Because"  
Mixing up different types of causation—logical reasons, psychological motivations, and physical causes. Each operates according to different principles and shouldn't be conflated.

  F. The Existential Fallacy (Confusing Essence and Existence)  
Assuming that because you can define or conceive of something, it must actually exist. This jumps from logical possibility to actual reality without justification.

  G. Confusing the Natural with the Common  
Assuming that what is statistically normal or common is therefore natural or good. This mistakes frequency of occurrence for inherent rightness or naturalness.
